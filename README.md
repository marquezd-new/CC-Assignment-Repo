# David Marquez's Creative Coding: Python Assignment Folder - Spring 2025
## This repo is where I will submit my assignments for the class. It is a new folder that I made after class 1.

Little by little, I am learning about what git is and also what python will be. WHile I feel confused now, I am looking forward to understanding what coding is.

I will use many resources to learn coding, mostly class, Googling and the links provided on the course's Canvas page, listed below
- ðŸ“• [Python basics](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/) by Al Sweigart
- ðŸ’» [Python basics: Expressions and strings](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/expressions-and-strings.ipynb) by Allison Parrish
- ðŸ’» [Python basics: Lists and loops](https://github.com/aparrish/progdat/blob/main/lists.ipynb) by Allison Parrish
- ðŸŽ¥ [Python As Fast as Possible by Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VchuKL44s6E) With Tim
- ðŸŽ¥ [Python Tutorial in 30 Minutes (Crash Course for Absolute Beginners)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEm3EUdicDg) by thenewboston

I am also intending to use the New York Public Library for guidance through their free [Python classes](https://www.nypl.org/techconnect).



This is how I feel in the class right now. But I'm hoping to get better!
